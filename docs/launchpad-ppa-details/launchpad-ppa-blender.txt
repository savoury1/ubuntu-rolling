Fresh builds of Blender 2.92.0 (and Blender 2.93.0 Alpha) for Xenial & newer.

Update (26 Feb 2021): New Blender 2.92.0 has been released and CUDA kernels are now built with a combination of CUDA 10.2 and 11.2 (SM_30 through SM_8x). Also, Blender >= 2.93 requires OpenColorIO >= 2.0.0 so OpenColorIO 1.1.1 is now packaged as opencolorio1 (providing libopencolorio1{-dev} packages) such that each OpenColorIO version can be used for different builds as required.

Update (15 Oct 2020): Upstream changes allow both CUDA 10 and 11 tools to be specified, meaning that CUDA kernels for SM_30 through SM_8x architectures are now buildable with the one pass. Thus, the latest 2.91.0 Alpha build has a more complete set of CUDA kernels than any previous version uploaded here.

Update (29 Sep 2020): New builds of Blender 2.91.0 Alpha are now available, built with USD (Universal Scene Description) support and pre-compiled CUDA 11.1 kernels. For Xenial systems CUDA 11.1 requires Linux kernel 4.5 or newer for bug-free functionality, just as for numerous newer than Xenial display drivers and graphics programs. See the table here about CUDA 11 requirements:

https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html

Also see the PPA https://launchpad.net/~savoury1/+archive/ubuntu/display for additional discussion about requiring kernel > 4.4 for newer display drivers.

* Note that both blender and blender-git versions can be co-installed on the same system. Achieved by packaging various blender* files as blender-git* such that there are no file conflicts with the two packages, plus they also use distinct config paths (~/.config/blender/2.92 & ~/.config/blender/2.93).

These are fresh builds with as many features enabled as possible. Making use of work by Irie Shinsuke [1] and Thomas Schiex [2] plus the Debian multimedia packaging team (thank you all!) and developing that work further this is now a fairly complete and up-to-date build of Blender. Packages found at this PPA that are not in default Debian or Ubuntu repos: Alembic, Open Image Denoise, Open Shading Language, Ptex, and now also Universal Scene Description (USD).

Note: Many of the above deps for Xenial & Bionic are interconnected with each other and have been copied here from other PPAs at this Launchpad site for an easier installation of Blender on older series without needing too many PPAs.

=============================================================================

*** Install ***

Notes for Xenial & Bionic: Blender is demanding software and recent versions require many newer system libraries than shipped with older series. Packages at this PPA are built against various other PPAs at this Launchpad site (see "Build" section below) and so require various newer packages from those PPAs to successfully install. This includes requiring GCC 9.3.0 (default GCC for Focal) as Blender packages here are built with a minimum of this GCC version.

Thus, installing Blender here requires these steps for Xenial & Bionic (many dependencies from the backports & graphics PPAs have now been copied here so those PPAs should not need to be added though if you find that a dependency is still missing even after doing the below steps then please let me know!):

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:savoury1/gcc-defaults-9
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:savoury1/ffmpeg4
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:savoury1/display
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:savoury1/blender
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
  sudo apt-get install blender

Understand that this will bring in many upgrades including to GCC 9.3.0 which will be made the system default GCC version. As always, please remember that it is wise to backup first before such a major upgrade process is undertaken!

If running nVidia hardware please see the display PPA for further information about nVidia drivers: https://launchpad.net/~savoury1/+archive/ubuntu/display

*** Note about Numpy: Due Blender 2.92+ requiring Python 3.9+ (Xenial default is Python 3.5, Bionic is 3.6, and Focal is 3.8) Blender at this PPA is built with Python 3.9 for all series. Thus default Numpy (from python3-numpy) that is installed to /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages will not work with Python 3.9 as used by Blender. A simple workaround for this is to install Numpy through pip, then add the user site-packages path to sys.path in a startup script.

All blender{-git}-data packages here depend on python3.9{-distutils} to make sure a complete Python 3.9 install is available. The following commands using Python 3.9 will install pip first and then a compatible Python Numpy package (bootstrap.pypa.io is hosted by the Python Packaging Authority or PyPA and so it is a trusted site in terms of downloading get-pip.py code to install pip):

  cd ~
  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.9
  python3.9 -m pip install --target=.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages numpy

Then a startup script can be added for Blender in the standard path for user configuration files. So use "~/.config/blender/2.92/scripts/startup" for 2.92 and create a file such as usercustomize.py (change "USER" in the below to the appropriate username on your system) with contents such as these two lines:

  import sys
  sys.path.insert(0, '/home/USER/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages')

The result will be that "import numpy" works fine after loading Blender on an older series (ie. Xenial or Bionic) making all Numpy functionality available.

*** Build ***

This PPA has build dependencies on:

  ppa:savoury1/build-tools
  ppa:savoury1/backports
  ppa:savoury1/graphics
  ppa:savoury1/multimedia
  ppa:savoury1/ffmpeg4

Additionally, required by Xenial & Bionic:

  ppa:savoury1/haskell-build
  ppa:savoury1/tex-2019
  ppa:savoury1/python
  ppa:savoury1/display  
  ppa:savoury1/gcc-defaults-9
  ppa:savoury1/llvm-defaults-10
  ppa:savoury1/boost-defaults1.71

Note about i386: Blender is not a good match for i386 architecture and 2.90+ fails to build on i386 even after carefully removing all amd64 only configs and dependencies. The Blender packages built here will thus be amd64 only, as that is clearly the only target architecture for all features. Bye bye i386!
