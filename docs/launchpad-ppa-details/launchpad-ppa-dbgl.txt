New build of DBGL (DOSBox Game Launcher) 0.83 (Java 8) for Xenial & newer.

INTRODUCTION

An open-source, free, multi-platform frontend for DOSBox. DBGL is a Java frontend for DOSBox, based largely upon the proven interface of D-Fend.

DBGL serves as a frontend / Graphical User Interface to DOSBox. It tries to make creating DOSBox configuration files a little easier by offering a relatively simple interface, some shortcuts and a little bit of intelligence. Once your DOS games are configured in DBGL, its very easy to setup or start them, or alter their configuration or associated DOSBox version.
