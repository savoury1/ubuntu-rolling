DOSBox 0.74-3 has been released!

A security release for DOSBox 0.74:

    * Fixed that a very long line inside a bat file would overflow the
      parsing buffer. (CVE-2019-7165 by Alexandre Bartel)
    * Added a basic permission system so that a program running inside DOSBox
      can't access the contents of /proc (e.g. /proc/self/mem) when / or
      /proc were (to be) mounted. (CVE-2019-12594 by Alexandre Bartel)
    * Several other fixes for out of bounds access and buffer overflows.
    * Some fixes to the OpenGL rendering.

The game compatibility should be identical to 0.74 and 0.74-2.
It's recommended to use config -securemode when dealing with untrusted files.
