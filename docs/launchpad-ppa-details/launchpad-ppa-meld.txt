Backports of Meld 3.20.3 (Bionic & newer) & 3.18.3 (Xenial, due GTK < 3.20).

For standard Xenial (without upgraded GTK components) Meld 3.18.3 is the highest possible version, due a GTK 3.20 requirement for Meld 3.19 and higher (Xenial ships with GTK 3.18.9). A new PPA for Xenial with backported Bionic GTK 3 (and associated packages) [*] now makes it possible to run the latest Meld on an upgraded Xenial system (GTK PPA includes Meld 3.20.1 for Xenial).
