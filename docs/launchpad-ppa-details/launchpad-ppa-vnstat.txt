Backport of vnstat 2.6 (network usage) for Xenial and newer.

README
======

# What is vnStat

vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor that uses the network
interface statistics provided by the kernel as information source. This
means that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures
light use of system resources regardless of network traffic rate.

By default, traffic statistics are stored on a five minute level for the last
48 hours, on a hourly level for the last 4 days, on a daily level for the
last 2 full months and on a yearly level forever. The data retention
durations are fully user configurable. Total seen traffic and a top days
listing is also provided. Optional png image output is available in systems
with the gd library installed.

Optional png image output is available in systems with the gd library
installed.

See the webpage https://humdi.net/vnstat/ for output examples.
