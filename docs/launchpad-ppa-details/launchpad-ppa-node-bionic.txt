Build of Node.js 8.17.0 and critical Node.js stack backports for Bionic only.

This PPA contains a new build of Node.js 8.17.0, the final version in the 8.x LTS series. It contains many security and bugfixes beyond version 8.10.0 that is in Bionic. There are also a few important backported packages here that provide improvements and bugfixes for the Node.js stack.

In particular, Node.js 8.11.x (largely 8.11.4) introduced critical fixes in the area of cryptography. Previous to that version, the node-diffie-hellman 5.0.2 package from Bionic would consistently FTBFS with the final three tests to do with prime numbers always failing. With Node.js 8.17.0 those DH prime tests work fine and the DH package builds successfully with tests enabled.
