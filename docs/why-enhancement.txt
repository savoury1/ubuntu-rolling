Why Enhancement?
================

* Many more package choices than from just the installed Ubuntu "series"

* Ability to create a moduler Ubuntu system to one's taste, with flexibility
  to update only specified components to new versions, while leaving other
  components at known desired/stable versions

* Easy access to version tables for multiple Ubuntu series from the terminal
  by using usual "apt-cache policy" commands with required package name
