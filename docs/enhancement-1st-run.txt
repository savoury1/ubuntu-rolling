Enhancement 1st Run -- General Notes
====================================

* Over 700 Bionic packages will be downloaded from Ubuntu repositories and
  then installed, so have patience! On a dual-core i7 system with fast SSD it
  took about 90 mins in a virtual machine for this 1st run. It is essentially
  a full system upgrade, so takes a similar amount of time to complete.

* Ignore warnings relating to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ conf files (broken symbolic
  links) during the upgrade process. These warnings are common with Xenial to
  Bionic upgrades (and get fixed later by deletion of broken symbolic links).

* Answer "Y" to any prompts about overwriting configuration files, unless you
  know what you are doing and are going to manually ensure that the mentioned
  files are up-to-date relative the new packages (and perhaps also include
  custom changes you have made).

* Accept the license that appears on screen during the upgrade if you want to
  install common TrueType fonts from a known big corporation (very useful).
